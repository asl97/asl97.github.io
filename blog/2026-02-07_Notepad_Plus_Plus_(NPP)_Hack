The Wish I took notice of the version before I updated notepad++, so I would know if I might have been affected by the hack.


If you are on version v8.8.0 or older, You aren't affected by the hack YET, but the version you have is vulnerable, don't use the built-in updater, instead download the new version from the website and update it

If you are on version v8.8.1 to v8.8.9, you might have updated and be affected as those are the versions available during the hack time frame, some people are going to the extreme and wiping their computer with a clean install.

If you are on version V8.9 or newer and are not sure if you used the built-in updater, you might also be affected even if it's not vulnerable anymore.
